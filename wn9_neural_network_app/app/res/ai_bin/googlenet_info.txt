googlenet-9.onnx : mean (123.68,116.779,103.939), variance(1.0,1.0,1.0)

*** Model Description ***

GoogLeNet is the name of a convolutional neural network for classification, which competed in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge in 2014.

Differences:

not training with the relighting data-augmentation;
not training with the scale or aspect-ratio data-augmentation;
uses "xavier" to initialize the weights instead of "gaussian";
